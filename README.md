# KernelMemoryAllocator
The goal of this task is to implement a simple memory allocation system. The memory allocation system should provide memory allocation and release at the kernel level of the operating system. Data allocation and dealocation is implemented using a slab system and a buddy system. The project hasn't been finished yet, it is necessary to provide multi-threaded execution
